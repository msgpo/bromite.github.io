# Take back your browser

<img title="Bromite - Take back your browser!" src="/bromite.png" width="96" alt="Bromite" />

Bromite is Chromium plus ad blocking and privacy enhancements; take back your browser!

The main goal is to provide a no-clutter browsing experience without privacy-invasive features and with the addition of a fast ad-blocking engine.

Minimal UI changes are applied to help curbing the idea of "browser as an advertisement platform".

All patches are published under [GNU/GPL v3](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/blob/master/LICENSE) to enable other open source projects' usage.

Bromite is available for Android v4.4 and above.
