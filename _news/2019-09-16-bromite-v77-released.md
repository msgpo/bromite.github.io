# Bromite v77 released

Bromite v77 has been released and switches to the native Chromium adblock engine.

The Bromite AdBlock update service has been developed from scratch to allow filter updates in Bromite without the need of downloading a new version of the application; see https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki/AdBlocking#update-mechanism for more information.

The SystemWebView will keep using the Bromite adblock engine for the time being.

Please report any bugs via the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues).
